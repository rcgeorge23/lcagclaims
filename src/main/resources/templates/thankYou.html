                            <p>
                                In order to become a full LCAG member, we ask for a small contribution towards our fighting fund.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The majority of the work we do is free of charge, the website and forum and other materials are
                                supplied and supported by members in their spare time. However some of our activities do require funding. For
                                example, PR, consultancy and advertising.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of our members have each contributed £100 to the fund. We understand that peoples’ circumstances are
                                very different and we will accept a smaller amount if you are experiencing financial difficulties.
                                We also understand that people are sometimes skeptical about generic funding requests. To address this, as part
                                of our regular update email (usually every 2 - 3 weeks), we provide a breakdown of our income and expenditure along with the
                                groups current bank account balance. Any member can request to see a full bank statement at any time should they wish to do
                                so.
